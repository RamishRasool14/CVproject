# CVproject

A university project in which video feeds from three different perspectives was combined to generate a top view of the scenery using homography. On top of that a detection system was made that uses object detection technique to find people in top view feed to generate heat map and intrusion detection system to raise alarm if the person is observed in prohibited area.

The output of the code and videos that were fed can be found on the link below.
